            <!---I'm so so sorry, future maintainers. Basically, what happens is that on mobile the layout is set to block, whereas on desktop it is grid. Therefore the content is laid out in the HTML in the order it is meant to appear on mobile,  then on desktop it is rearranged by the grid into a totally different order. Have fun! --->

                    <p>Are you intrested in the technical side of events? Why not come along to one of our New Members’ Introduction sessions, where we will go through some of our huge range of kit and how to use it.
No experience is required - all knowledge levels are welcome.<br>
We will provide you with the training required to be part of our team, so come along and see what it’s all about. TEC is all about getting stuck in! 
Once you’ve attended a New Members’ Introduction, you can come along to any TEC event. Coming along doesn't mean you're committing to TEC - why not come and try it out? We'd love to have you as part of the team.</p>
