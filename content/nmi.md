In TEC, we're all about getting stuck in! Interested in working on the technical side of events? Our New Members Introduction sessions introduce you to some of our kit and how to use it. No experience necessary, but all experience welcome. We will provide you with the training to be part of the team, so come along and see what we're all about!

Our sessions are an introduction to what we do, and what kit we do it with. They also cover basic health and safety and manual handling, so that you come away from the session able to attend *any* event we provide.

The best part of all is that TEC is entirely free. Whether you're into lighting, sound or event management, you will have plenty of opportunity to have a go with our equipment. Coming along doesn't mean you're committing to TEC - why not come and try it out? We'd love to have you as part of the team.
