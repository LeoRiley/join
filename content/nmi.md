Interested in working on the technical side of events? Come along to one of our try it sessions, where we will introduce you to some of our kit and how to use it. We support a wide variety of events which run throughout the academic year, ranging from a small open mic night to multi venue events such as Graduation Ball.

In TEC, we're all about getting stuck in. We hold two New Members Introduction sessions annually to give new and potential members a chance to get a feel for what we do. Don't worry if you've never done anything like this before - training will be provided.

Once you've been to one of the sessions, you're welcome to come on any of our events that take your fancy. Whether you're into lighting, sound or event management, you will have plenty of opportunity to have a go with our equipment.

Running events is what we do, but don't think we're only about hard work – we also enjoy kicking back with a range of social activities, whether it’s bouldering, watching musicals or hanging out in the pub. When we're not running events, you're most likely to find us in our office on the C floor of the Portland building.

It is is aimed at those with little previous experience, but we welcome those with any level of technical expertise. We will provide you with the training necessary to jump right in and be part of the team. So come along and see what we're all about. 

Our sessions cover:

* Lighting training
* Sound training
* Manual handling training
* Basic health and safety training
* And introducing the TEC members website

Once you've attended our introductory session, you can come along to any event that we operate in - and the best part of all is that TEC is entirely free.

There is no experience necessary, and we provide all the training and support both at events and at dedicated training sessions. Plus, coming along doesn't mean you're committing to TEC - come and see if it's for you, we'd love to have you as part of the team.
