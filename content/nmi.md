In TEC, we're all about getting stuck in! Interested in working on the technical side of events? 

We hold two New Members Introduction sessions annually where we will introduce you to some of our kit and how to use it. Don't worry if you've never done anything like this before - training will be provided.

It is is aimed at those with little previous experience, but we welcome those with any level of technical expertise. We will provide you with the training necessary to jump right in and be part of the team. So come along and see what we're all about! 

Our sessions cover:

* Lighting training
* Sound training
* Manual handling training
* Basic health and safety training
* And introducing the TEC members website

Once you've attended our introductory session, you can come along to any event that we operate in - and the best part of all is that TEC is entirely free. Whether you're into lighting, sound or event management, you will have plenty of opportunity to have a go with our equipment.

Coming along doesn't mean you're committing to TEC - come and see if it's for you, we'd love to have you as part of the team.
