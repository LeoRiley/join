### TEC provides extensive training ###

From winch stands to balanced audio to lighting design. TEC's in-house training system takes whatever prior knowledge you have - which need not be any at all - and augments it with a wealth of knowledge on our equipment and how to set it up. There's also plenty of opportunity to learn to maintain and repair all of our equipment.

You could learn to drive our van and trailer. The Union also often provide our members First Aid and Fire Safety training - really useful skills to have.


### Don't think we're only about hard work! ###

Running events may be what we do but we also enjoy kicking back with a range of social activities - whether itâ€™s go karting, watching musicals or hanging out in the pub.
