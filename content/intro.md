### From festivals to bar nights, we do it all!

We do sound, lighting and lots more, in and beyond the University of Nottingham Students Union. 
We support a wide variety of events which run throughout the academic year, ranging from a small open mic night to multi venue events such as Graduation Ball.

### TEC provides extensive training from winch stands to balanced audio to lighting design

You could learn to drive our van and trailer. The Union also often provide our members First Aid and Fire Safety training - really useful skills to have.

### Running events is what we do, but don't think we're only about hard work!

We also enjoy kicking back with a range of social activities, whether itâ€™s go karting, watching musicals or hanging out in the pub.
