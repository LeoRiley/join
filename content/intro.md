We do sound, lighting and lots more in the University of Nottingham Students Union and beyond. 
We support a wide variety of events which run throughout the academic year, ranging from a small open mic night to multi venue events such as Graduation Ball.
TEC provides extensive training from winch stands to balanced audio.

Running events is what we do, but don't think we're only about hard work – we also enjoy kicking back with a range of social activities, whether it’s bouldering, watching musicals or hanging out in the pub. When we're not running events, you're most likely to find us in our office on the C floor of the Portland building.
